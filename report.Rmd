# Abstract


# Background and Motivation


# Purpose/objective of this project - Forethought Project background 


# Data and Methodology

## Data Sources

The four datasets analyzed in this report comprise posts and comments are pulled from Facebook and Instagram social media, regarding the four brands Amaysim, Optus, Telstra, and Vodafone.

## Data Cleaning

### Preliminary cleaning:

In the data preparation phase, several vital functions are used. The `rep_str` function is used to set up a replacement text for Emojis. While the `str_replace_all` function is deployed to systematically replace Emoji texts in both the posts and comments datasets.

Additionally, the `gsub` function plays a crucial role in the substitution of spaces, commas, and other special characters within variables, ensuring data is tidy. For more targeted character adjustments, regular expressions are employed. The `separate` function is used for splitting a character column into two columns to meet specific requirements. Extracting specified strings is facilitated by the `str_extract` function.

Ensuring uniformity in date formats is a critical step. Both posts' publish dates and customers' comment dates are standardized using the `mdy` function. Furthermore, dates denoted as *two weeks ago*, *one day ago*, *three months ago*, and so on are harmonized into a standard date format using the `add_with_rollback` function.

### Deep cleaning (for the development of our R Shiny application):

Utilizing the `select` function to filter out brand names and post URLs from the posts dataset, which are then stored in a separate dataset labeled *FB/IG_url*. To ensure uniformity, brand names are standardized within the posts dataset. The `pivot_longer` function converts the data for customer actions, comments, and shares on Facebook, as well as likes, comments, and views on Instagram, into a long format. It is convenient to use the `facet_wrap` function to draw multi-panel time series plots about different customer reactions when making R shiny. This feature allows for a clear and organized presentation of data, making it easier for users to compare and analyze trends across different response metrics.

The comments dataset and *FB/IG_url* are in-joined using the `inner_join` function to match which brand each customer's comments belong to. Furthermore, a crucial aspect of the data preparation involved performing an inner join operation using the `inner_join` function between the comments dataset and the *FB/IG_url* dataset. This operation could establish clear associations between customer comments and their respective brands.

Acquiring a set of stop words utilizing the `get_stopwords` function, employing the snowball lexicon. These stopwords are stored in a dataset named *stopword*. Both posts and comments are separated into individual words or pairs of words using the `unnest_tokens` function. This step is essential for further analysis. The *stopword* dataset is reintegrated using a back-join operation with the `anti_join` function, effectively removing the identified stop words. The resulting dataset is stored for subsequent use in generating wordclouds, sentiment analysis plots, and other analytical outputs.

Introducing a new variable pertaining to brands within the themes of posts dataset with the `append` function. Merging the datasets pertaining to themes of posts from both Facebook and Instagram, using the `rbind` function to ensure a unified and comprehensive view of brand-related.

## Data Limitations

- Limited historical data: Access to historical data through APIs poses a constraint on long-term trend analysis. For example, Facebook's Graph API typically allows access to data from the past 90 days. This limitation necessitates a focused approach to extracting and interpreting data within this time frame.

- Sample bias: It is crucial to recognize that the customer base actively engaging on social media platforms may not fully represent the broader population. This inherent bias can influence the insights derived from the data, prompting a cautious approach to generalizing findings.

- Sparse data: Data sparsity emerged as a significant consideration. Not all customers furnish comprehensive information, and not all posts contain pertinent data for analysis. This scarcity can impact the depth and scope of analytical endeavors.

- Data quality: An additional challenge arose from the diverse and sometimes unstructured nature of customer-generated content. Comments often encompassed a range of linguistic variations, including slang, potential spelling errors, and non-standard language. These intricacies presented hurdles for natural language processing tasks.

## Methodologies

### Time series method

Employing a time series plot to illustrate the trend of customer reactions to brand posts over time on both Facebook and Instagram. Each brand is represented by a distinct color, offering a clear visual distinction. To further enhance visualization, use the `facet_wrap` function to create multiple panels. For Facebook, these panels encompass a combination of reactions, comments, and shares, while for Instagram, they comprise likes, comments, and views. This segmentation enables users to quickly discern the trends in customer engagement metrics over time. This approach provides an effective means to assess the popularity of each brand's posts across both platforms. The use of color coding and facet panels enhances the visual clarity, allowing for a detailed examination of customer reactions.

### Natural Language Processing (NLP) method

While gauging the 'heat' of each brand's posts is informative, it is essential to delve deeper into the insights that social media data offers. Unlike conventional surveys or questionnaires, individual expressions on social media are highly personalized. Therefore, employing advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques becomes instrumental in extracting nuanced insights. By harnessing NLP methods, such as word cloud mapping, sentiment analysis, and customer behavioral analysis, users can gain a more profound understanding of prevailing social media trends and brand performance. These techniques can dissect the language and sentiments expressed by customers, providing a comprehensive view of public opinions and attitudes. Incorporating NLP methodologies not only unveils hidden patterns but also allows us to capture sentiments that might elude traditional analysis approaches. This method, in turn, equips a more accurate and insightful assessment of social media trends and customer behavior.

### OpenAI Large Language Model API

In the realm of social media data analysis, using the power of the openAI Large Language Model API for textual summarization. API is a critical tool in extracting textual topics from the vast pool of social media content by filtering out extraneous and less relevant information and obtaining the most meaningful topics, providing users with a clear and concise overview for informed decision-making and strategic planning.
